<h3>Query API: Response Options, Metadata, and Paging</h3>

<p>By default the Open Context API returns a wide variety information in response to a query request. The responses include, metadata, a variety of search facets, geo-spatial data (in the form of regional facets and result records) and some non-geospatial results. You can limit the types of responses you get from Open Context searches by adding the <samp>response</samp> parameter and a comma separated list of response types to a request URL. For example, the <samp><a target="_blank" title="Metadata request" href="{{ base_url }}/subjects-search/United+States.json?response=metadata">{{ base_url }}/subjects-search/United+States.json?response=metadata</a></samp> request only gets metadata about a search result, while <samp><a target="_blank" title="Metadata and URI request" href="{{ base_url }}/subjects-search/United+States.json?response=metadata,uri">{{ base_url }}/subjects-search/United+States.json?response=metadata,uri</a></samp> gets metadata and URIs of result records. Allowed response types are:</p>

<ul>
    <li><samp>metadata</samp>: metadata about a search, includes paging information, number of records found, etc.</li>
    <li><samp>facet</samp>: search facets that <em>ARE NOT</em> GeoJSON region facets (see the GeoJSON discussion) and <em>ARE NOT</em> chronological span facets</li>
    <li><samp>chrono-facet</samp>: search facets for chronological spans (see the Query Facets discussion)</li>
    <li><samp>geo-facet</samp>: search facets that <em>ARE</em> GeoJSON region facets (see the GeoJSON discussion)</li>
    <li><samp>geo-record</samp>: result records as GeoJSON features (see the GeoJSON discussion)</li>
    <li><samp>uri-meta</samp>: result records as a simple list of URIs and some attributes</li>
    <li><samp>uri</samp>: result records as a simple list of URIs</li>
    <li><samp>solr</samp>: raw and unprocessed Solr query response (these will be very difficult to process given the high-level of abstraction in Open Context's Solr schema)</li>
</ul>

<p>The table below introduces some of the general metadata and linking options (especially paging) provided by the Query API:</p>

            <td>
                <p>The Query API returns summary time span information for the set of results obtained from a query. Time intervals describe general date ranges relevant to the formation, use, and/or life of items described in the search results. The API expresses the date information as ISO 8601 defined string values in the <samp>start</samp> and <samp>stop</samp> limits (the same kind of expression used in <a onclick="javascript:change_tab('#geojson-ld');">GeoJSON "when"</a> objects). The <samp>dc-terms:temporal</samp> key provides the same time-span information in a manner consistent with Pelagios project (see <a href="https://github.com/pelagios/pelagios-cookbook/wiki/Joining-Pelagios">documentation here</a>) patterns.</p>

                Paging
            </th>
            <td>
                <p>The Query API returns links to page through the list of query result records. Paging links are provided for both HTML and JSON versions as follows:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><samp>first</samp>, first page</li>
                    <li><samp>previous</samp>, previous page</li>
                    <li><samp>next</samp>, next page</li>
                    <li><samp>last</samp>, last page</li>
                </ol>
                <p>In addition to paging, the Query API provides details about the start of the index number of the current page's search results. <samp>"startIndex": 0</samp> is the beginning of the list of results. As one pages through the search results, the <samp>startIndex</samp> increases. You can change the number of results returned per page with the <samp>rows</samp> parameter. Open Context defaults to 20 records per page and this can be increased to 1000 with <samp>rows=1000</samp>.</p>
