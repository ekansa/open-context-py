                <p>Open Context offers a variety of search options ranging from simple fulltext searchs to more sophisticated faceted browse tools. Fulltext searches work like conventional search engines, simply matching characters you typed in your query. Faceted browse provides more precise ways to query data (and metadata) through a point-and-click interface to select different search filters. Common search facets include context, project, descriptive attributes specific to a given project, and descriptive attributes common to many projects (we add links to such common standards as part of our editorial workflow). You can browse through objects by typology, materials, and other attributes defined by data contributors. You can combine fulltext search with faceted browse also.
                </p>
                <p>These search tools make it easy to find and examine individual records published by Open Context. The records may describe objects or contexts relevant to your research interests. You may use and cite them in comparative analyses or other applications.</p>

                <h3>Find and Reuse Images</h3>
                <p>Contributing researchers often provide images (drawings and photographs) to further document datasets. You can find relevant images using the search and faceted browse tools discussed above. The images published by Open Context carry Creative Commons copyright licenses. These licenses give explicit permission to reuse content, including the images, provided you properly cite creators. So you can use images published by Open Context in your own websites, presentations, or in your own publications, provided you cite the image creator with the information provided in the "Suggested Citation" box associated with each image.

                <p>Structured data &mdash; meaning data meant for quantification and analysis &mdash; represents a large fraction of the content published by Open Context. While Open Context offers powerful APIs (<a href="{{ base_url }}/about/services" title="Learn more about Open Context APIs">Application Program Interfaces</a>), many users will prefer to simply download structured data in CSV format for use with Excel or other software.

In addition, because field notes typically link to objects and contexts, you can browse field notes with the <a href="{{ base_url }}/search/?type=documents">faceted search interface</a> according to context and other metadata attributes.

Each site file record has its own unique Web URI (Uniform Resource Identifier). You can reference these Web URIs to explicitly relate your data with DINAA and an increasing array of data and collections associated with DINAA.

                <h3>Reference Descriptive Attribute and Type URIs</h3>
                <p>When researchers publish data with Open Context, they also publish their recording attributes and types (see this <a href="{{ base_url }}/predicates/86-wei-zhi-bone-zones-present" title="Example descriptive attribute">well-described example</a>). Sharing recording systems, typological systems, and controlled vocabularies is important because many areas of research lack common recording standards. Each descriptive attribute and type published by Open Context can be referenced with a stable URI. It is good practice to reference these URIs to relate new datasets with relevant datasets published by colleagues. Even if one does not agree with every typological category or descriptive attribute, explicitly noting related concepts can be a key to long term interoperability.

                <p>While Open Context has a variety of search and browse interfaces, there are many, many more valuable ways to visualize and explore Open Context published data. Open Context offers a a variety of APIs (<a href="{{ base_url }}/about/services">Application Program Interfaces</a>) that can enable programmers to develop new interfaces, visualizations, and analysis tools. Stay tuned for examples of programs and analyses using Open Context APIs.
