# About all_items.editorial.serializers

These modules provide data export and import functionality to move records from an Open Context project
from one instance to another.

The usual workflow has been to dump records serialized as JSON from one Open Context instance into a
directory (created for a given project). The directory and contents get moved to another Open Context
instance for loading.
