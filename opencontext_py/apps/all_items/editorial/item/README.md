# About all_items.editorial.item

This module has several functions used to support client-side user interface requests to edit,
add, and delete Open Context items.

Eventually, we will add user authentication and security limits on these, as well as unit and
regression tests.

This functions are the backend components associated with user-interface components 
in Vue.js and Bootstrap.
